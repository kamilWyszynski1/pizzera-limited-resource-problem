University project for concurrent programming class

### Assumptions
Pizzeria contains X1, X2, X3, X4 tables, every single one may have 1,2,3 or 4 chairs. Clients may occupy the table on condition that they have orderded pizza(orderning time can be ommited). It's unacceptable for client to wait for place to eat with ordered pizza. Clients come to pizzeria alone, or in groups of 2-3 people. Various groups can't ocupy the same table, unless their sizes are equal.
